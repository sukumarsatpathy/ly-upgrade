                    <p><strong>Mission: Health, happiness and world peace through laughter</strong></p>
                    <p>World Laughter Day was created in 1998 by Dr. Madan Kataria, founder of the worldwide Laughter Yoga
                        movement. The celebration of World Laughter Day is a positive manifestation for world peace and is
                        intended to build up a global consciousness of brotherhood and friendship through laughter. Today, we
                        are surrounded with a sea of negativity â€“ violence, terrorism, natural disasters, global warming, bad
                        economy and other stressors. When people are happy and healthy they contribute to world peace.</p>
                    <p><strong>How can we bring World Peace through Laughter?</strong></p>
                    <p>Formula is very simple -When you laugh; you change and when you change the world changes around you.
                        Inner change is the key to see the change in the outer world. The war in the external world the
                        reflection of the inner war going on in the minds of people. Unconditional laughter has the power to
                        change the inner chemistry and make us feel good inside. When you feel good inside, it changes the
                        perception of outer world. <br>Laughter is the easiest and cost-effective solution for physical, mental,
                        social and spiritual well-being.</p>
                    <p><strong>Universal Language</strong></p>
                    <p>Laughter is a universal language, we all speak and it helps to connect people from different cultures and
                        countries. Through the network of free social Laughter Clubs, we are creating a worldwide community of
                        caring and sharing people who believe in unconditional love, kindness and compassion.</p>
                    <p><strong>When and What happens on WLD</strong></p>
                    <p>First Sunday of every May is World Laughter Day. On this day the laughter club members and their friends
                        and families get together in important squares public parks to laugh together to send out positive
                        vibrations of unconditional love, laughter, kindness and compassion.</p>
