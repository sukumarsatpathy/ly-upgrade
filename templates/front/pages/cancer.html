                    <h1>Laughter Yoga for Cancer patients</h1>
                    <p>Cancer is considered a killer disease. When someone is struck with cancer it leads to intense
                        stress and fear. How can laughter yoga help? Laughter Yoga as a physical intervention leads to
                        real physiological and biochemical changes in our body that have a profound effect on the
                        development of cancer</p>
                    <p>Laughter yoga provides a non-intellectual path to laughter. Cancer patients may be in emotional
                        turmoil and become depressed, making it difficult for them to achieve laughter through
                        intellectual stimuli like humorous videos. Laughter yoga approaches laughter as a body exercise
                        that can easily be done regardless of mood.</p>

                        <h1>Oxygen for Cancer Healing</h1>
                        <p>Oxygen is one of the primary catalysts for all metabolic reactions in the human body. Ongoing
                            scientific studies show that lack of oxygen is the major cause of most diseases. Laughter
                            Yoga flushes the lungs and fully oxygenates the blood and major organs leaving one bursting
                            with energy and vitality. Research has also shown that cancer cells are destroyed in the
                            presence of oxygen. In fact, many parasites and bacteria don’t survive well in the presence
                            of oxygen; therefore an increase in the oxygen levels with laughter exercises is a great way
                            to combat diseases.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Otto Warburg, President, Institute of Cell Physiology and Nobel Prize Winner said
                            something very profound about the role of oxygen in maintaining good health: “Deep breathing
                            techniques increase oxygen to the cells and are the most important factors in living a
                            disease-free and energetic life. When cells get enough oxygen, cancer will not and cannot
                            occur.”</p>

                    <h1>Laughter Boosts The Immune System</h1>
                    <p>A weak immune system is a major cause for almost all sickness and ill health. One spends
                        millions on prescription drugs while overlooking the natural coping mechanisms of the body
                        intended to restore health.
                        The lowering of the immune system is also somewhat responsible in the development of cancer.
                        Laughter quickly increases immunoglobulin levels that help fight infection and increases the
                        number of Natural Killer Cells (NK cells) in the blood, which plays a key role in cancer
                        prevention. Disease-fighting proteins increase in gamma interferon, a blood chemical that
                        transmits messages in the nervous system and stimulates the immune system.</p>

                        <h1>Stress and Depression in Cancer Patients</h1>
                        <p>Most cancer patients, family, friends and caregivers all need some relief from the stress.
                            They also experience varying degrees of depression. Laughter Yoga can help to counter both.
                            Hearty laughter reduces cortisol which is the major stress hormone whilst releasing happy
                            chemicals. This helps them get into a better mood state. Laughter may not cure the disease
                            but it will definitely help in enhancing one’s ability to cope with the disease as well as
                            improve the long term chances of survival, by maintaining a positive attitude.</p>
