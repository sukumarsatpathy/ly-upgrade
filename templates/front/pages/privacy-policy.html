        <p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and
            other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this
            Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information
            to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Therefore, although we use industry-standard
            practices protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally
            identifiable information or private communications would always remain private. We do however assure you
            that any and all disclosure of your personally identifiable information shall be personally intimated to you
            through an email sent to your provided email address.</p>
        <p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third

        <ul>
            <li><strong>External Service Providers:</strong> There may be a number of services offered by external
                service providers that
                help you use our Platform. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so,
                disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect
                information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Law and Order:</strong> We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third
                parties to enforce
                laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorise us to)
                disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole
                discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual
                property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="h5 font-weight-bold py-3">10. Accessing, Reviewing And Changing Your Profile</div>
        <p>Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted at the stage of registration,
            except Email ID and mobile number. An option for facilitating such change shall be present on the Platform
            and such change shall be facilitated by the User. If you change any information, we may or may not keep
            track of your old information. We will not retain in our files information you have requested to remove for
            certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and
            conditions. Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases, including stored ‘back
            up’ systems. If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, or to
            remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the User needs to remediate, and promptly correct any
            such incorrect information.</p>

        <div class="h5 font-weight-bold py-3">11. Control Of Your Password</div>
        <p>You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you
            protect it against unauthorised access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully
            and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.</p>
        <p>You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another Member at any time or to
            disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
            information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
            control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on
            your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change
            your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorised use of your
            account or access to your password even after changing it.</p>

        <div class="h5 font-weight-bold py-3">12. Security</div>
        <p>We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorised access. We employ many
            different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access by members inside and outside
            the Company. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted
            to us and information that we have accessed.</p>
        <p>However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. Our Company cannot
            guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you provide won’t be
            intercepted while being transmitted to the Company over the Internet.</p>

            all and any other paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or indicated by the context
            of the agreement. The decision or declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void shall
            have no effect on the remaining paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>

        <div class="h5 font-weight-bold py-3">14. Amendment</div>
        <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use
            of your information and will always be at the Platform. Any amendments to this Policy shall be deemed as
